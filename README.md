# Sudoku-with-CSP-paradigm
The provided Python code utilizes the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach to solve a Sudoku puzzle, employing backtracking and constraint propagation to iteratively fill in the grid's empty cells based on the rules of Sudoku.

## Initialization: 
The code initializes a 9x9 Sudoku grid with given values and a graphical user interface using the Pygame library.

## Grid Drawing: 
The Pygame window displays the initial state of the Sudoku grid, showing the unsolved puzzle.

## CSP Solving:
The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver is implemented to find a solution for the Sudoku puzzle.

## Backtracking: 
The solver uses a backtracking approach to explore possible values for empty cells, checking the validity of each move.

## Constraint Propagation: 
The code employs constraint propagation by updating and displaying the grid during solving, showing the intermediate steps.

## Final State Display: 
Once the CSP solver completes, the Pygame window displays the final solved state of the Sudoku grid.

## User Interaction:
The program waits for the user to close the Pygame window, ending the execution.
